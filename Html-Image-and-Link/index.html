    <h2><ins>Who Am I ?</ins></h2>
    <p>
      I am a European breed
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobermann">Doberman</a> with
      ancestry from Germany. In the moonlight's gentle embrace, I stood tall and
      vigilant, With eyes that mirrored the stars, I watched over my domain, the
      very embodiment of loyalty and unwavering devotion. Each step I took
      resonated with the grace of a guardian, my heart beating in rhythm with
      the secrets of the shadows. In the quietude of the night, I was more than
      a dog; I was a protector, a confidant, and a silent companion to those who
      walked the paths of darkness.
